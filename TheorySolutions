PART 1 THEORY: 



m) How can we achieve this (2 methods) ? Write the steps to these 2 methods in a text file.

By moving script to a directory in PATH which is an environment variable 
OR
By adding the current directory to PATH 


n) We would like this change to be permanent, how can we do this?

By exporting 
export PATH
and then adding it to shell configuration file (bashrc)

o) We just made this change permanent, but we donâ€™t want to wait until another terminal is
opened, we would like to make this change NOW, and in this terminal. What could we do?

Use source instead of executing using ./
This way we don't open a subprocess, and the execution happens in our current environment, maintaining state and variables and not resorting to opening new terminal
